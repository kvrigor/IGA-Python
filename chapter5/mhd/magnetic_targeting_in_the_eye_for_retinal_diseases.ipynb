    "These test cases provide a starting point for simulating Magnetic Drug Targeting using the Finite Element Method. Considerations include the choice of mesh, fluid dynamics simulation, and the incorporation of magnetic fields for guiding drug-carrying particles to specific targets within the body. The models should be adapted based on the specific characteristics of the targeted tissue and the drug delivery system.\n",
