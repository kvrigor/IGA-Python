    "These test cases provide a starting point for simulating MHD Dynamo Theory. Actual applications may involve more complex geometries, additional physical effects, and tailored boundary conditions based on specific scenarios. Dynamo theory often involves studying the evolution of magnetic fields over time and understanding the mechanisms that amplify and sustain magnetic fields in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.\n",
