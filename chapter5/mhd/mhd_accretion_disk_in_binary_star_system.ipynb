    "These test cases provide a starting point for simulating MHD Astrophysical phenomena using the Finite Element Method. The choice of mesh type and refinement, numerical methods, and solver settings will depend on the specific requirements and complexities of the astrophysical scenario being modeled. It's also important to consider adaptive mesh refinement strategies for capturing dynamic and localized features accurately.\n",
